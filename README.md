project will be abandoned as it is

I’ve had to sell my PS4 recently to support my family during a tough time. It wasn’t an easy decision, but one I had to make. I still hope to eventually fund a PS5, not just to enjoy gaming again, but to contribute meaningfully to the PS5 and FPKG scenes in the future.
